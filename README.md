# RSS-Scraping
Fetches recent news articles through RSS feeds of news sources using JSOUP. User can select desired news sources and news subject. It scores each article in an algorithm I created based on interest.

First made as a culminating project for the course "ICS 4U1".

*NOTE* Scoring functionality no longer works. The algorithm depends on Wikipedia sites.
